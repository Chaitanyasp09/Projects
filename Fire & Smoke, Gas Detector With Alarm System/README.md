# Fire & Smoke, Gas Detector with Alarm System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a cost-effective fire alarm system using Arduino Uno and various sensors to detect smoke, fire, and gas hazards. The system triggers alarms and alerts in case of detected dangers, helping to prevent potential fire incidents in residential and commercial settings.

## Components Used
- **MQ2 Gas Sensor:** Detects gases such as LPG, propane, methane, smoke, and carbon monoxide.
- **Flame Sensor:** Detects infrared light emitted by flames.
- **Arduino Uno:** Microcontroller board for processing sensor data and controlling alarms.
- **Buzzer:** Produces audible alerts.
- **LEDs:** Visual indicators of alarm status.

## Working Environment
- **IDE:** Arduino IDE, used for programming the Arduino Uno.
- **Simulation:** Tinkercad was used for circuit simulation and design.
